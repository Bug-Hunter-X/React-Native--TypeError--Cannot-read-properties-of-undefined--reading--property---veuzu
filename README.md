# React Native: TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'property')

This repository demonstrates a common React Native error: attempting to access a property of an object that is null or undefined. This typically happens when dealing with asynchronous data fetching, where components try to render before the data is available.

## Bug Description:
The bug occurs when the app tries to render a component that depends on data from an API call before the call has finished and returned data. If the data hasn't loaded yet, trying to access a property of that object results in the error `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'property')`.

## Bug Reproduction Steps:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the dependencies: `npm install`.
3. Run the app: `npx react-native run-android` (or `npx react-native run-ios`).
4. Observe the error in the console.
